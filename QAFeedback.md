# week4challenge

## What was the challenge?
Write a playbook that installs Docker onto the local machine.

## How I expected the challenge to go.
I thought it was fair, and I expected to face more issues due to the technical challenges I faced but my code worked in the end.

## What went well?
I feel althought I didn't have much practice time I believe I understood the logic behind it and was confortable creating the playbook.

## What didn't go as planned?
My vm didn't work for half of the time but I had a window when it worked and was able to test my playbook for the main task. The only frustation is that I couldn't really try the strech goal.

## Possible improvements for future challenges.
Keep on practising.
